ion3-scripts (20060215-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Upstream renamed a lot of files to contain underscores (_) instead of
    dashes (-) so that they have a uniform naming scheme. If your ion3
    configuration refers to such scripts literally (i.e. dopath), please
    check the correctness of your references.
  
    The old "look-" files in /etc/X11/ion3 are per default preserved, and
    their equivalent "look_" files are installed additionaly, so that you
    do not lose customization. If you don't need them anymore, they can
    safely be deleted.
