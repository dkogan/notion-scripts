general
-------

To change configuration options in scripts and status monitors, you do
neither need to copy them to your user-local ion3 directory nor to
modify them in the system-wide place.

You can configure them from other configuration files and load them
/before/ you load the actual script, so that your configuration is
preserved on upgrades of the ion3-scripts package. Scripts will use
the configuration that is already present in the environment.

For configuration templates, have a look into the script you are going
to configure.

ion3-scripts
------------

ion3-scripts is a collection of user-contributed lua scripts from the
ion-scripts-3 darcs repository. It can be found online at
http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-scripts-3/

A brief description the scripts can be found as a comment in each one
as well as in index.html. They can be found in /etc/X11/ion3 for themes
and /usr/share/ion3 for scripts and monitors.


Status monitors
---------------
To use the status monitors, do not load them explicitly using 'dopath'. Just use
their name in the template of your statusbar configuration "cfg_statusbar.lua".
For example, use this template to use statusd_mpd.lua, statusd_batt.lua and
statusd_uptime.lua:

	template="[ %mpd || %batt || %uptime ]"

Themes
------
After installation, the newly-installed themes are visible in your Ion3 menu.
